# Documenting Findings

After completing vulnerability scanning and enumeration, all identified issues were properly documented to maintain a clear vulnerability tracking record.

## Tools Used
- **Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel** – Vulnerability tracking
- **Screenshots** – Evidence collection

## Information Recorded
- Target IP Address: `192.168.8.144`
- Open Ports and Running Services
- Vulnerability Name and Description  
  - Example: *Apache Tomcat – Outdated Version*
- Severity Level (CVSS Score if available)
- Associated CVE IDs
- Tool Used (OpenVAS / Nikto / Nmap)
- Date of Discovery
- Current Status (Open / Verified / Fixed)

## Steps Performed

### 1. Create Vulnerability Tracker
A spreadsheet was created with the following columns:
- IP Address  
- Port  
- Service  
- Vulnerability Description  
- Severity  
- CVE ID  
- Evidence (Screenshot)  
- Remarks  

### 2. Collect Evidence
Screenshots of:
- Scan results
- Vulnerability details
- CVSS scoring information  
were captured and stored for reference.

### 3. Maintain Consistent Records
All findings were recorded systematically to ensure accuracy, traceability, and ease of reporting.

## Outcome
Proper documentation helped in:
- Understanding the overall security posture
- Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk
- Preparing a structured penetration testing report
