# Pentesting Environment Setup

Here I am using Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable as the target machine.
Both virtual machines are configured using VMware.



This lab is created for learning and practicing penetration testing and vulnerability assessment in a safe environment.

## Requirements

VMware Workstation

Kali Linux (Attacker Machine)

Metasploitable (Target Machine)

## Setup Overview

Install VMware on your system

Import Kali Linux VM

Import Metasploitable VM

Configure both VMs on the same network (Host-only / NAT)

Verify connectivity between attacker and target.
