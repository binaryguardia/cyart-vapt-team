# Web Vulnerability Scanning (Nikto)

In this phase, I performed web server vulnerability scanning using **Nikto** against the Metasploitable machine to identify common misconfigurations and known web vulnerabilities.

## Tool Used
- **Nikto** – Web server scanner
- **Target IP**: `192.168.8.144`
- **Target Port**: `80`

## Steps Performed

### 1. Run Nikto Scan
```bash
nikto -h http://192.168.8.144
```
### 2. Scan Analysis
Nikto identified:
Outdated web server components
Insecure HTTP headers
Potentially dangerous files and directories
Known vulnerable scripts

## Outcome

Nikto successfully detected multiple web-related weaknesses, confirming the presence of insecure web configurations on the target machine.
