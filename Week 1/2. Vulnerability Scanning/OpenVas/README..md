# Vulnerability Scanning

In this phase, I performed vulnerability assessment against a deliberately vulnerable machine (**Metasploitable**) using **OpenVAS**, which is pre-installed in **Kali Linux**.

## Tools Used
- **OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)** – Network vulnerability scanner
- **Target Machine**: Metasploitable
- **Target IP**: `192.168.8.144`
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux

## Steps Performed

### 1. Start OpenVAS Service
```bash
sudo gvm-start
```
After starting the service, OpenVAS runs on:

https://127.0.0.1:9392

2. Login to OpenVAS Web Interface

    Open browser and go to https://127.0.0.1:9392

    Login using OpenVAS credentials

3. Create a Target

    Navigate to Configuration → Targets

    Create a new target

    Enter target IP:

192.168.8.144

4. Create and Launch Scan Task

    Go to Scans → Tasks

    Create a new task

    Select the created target

    Use default scan configuration

    Start the scan

6. Analyze Scan Results

After scan completion, the following details were analyzed:

  Detected vulnerabilities

  CVSS scores (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

  Associated CVE IDs

  Affected services and ports

Outcome

OpenVAS successfully identified multiple known vulnerabilities on the Metasploitable machine, validating the insecure configuration of the target and demonstrating the effectiveness of automated vulnerability scanning.
