# Advanced Vulnerability Exploitation

Advanced exploitation involves chaining vulnerabilities, customizing public exploits,
and bypassing defensive mechanisms.

## Exploit Chaining
An exploit chain combines multiple vulnerabilities to achieve a higher impact.
In this assessment, reconnaissance identified UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 running on port 6667.
This service contained a backdoor allowing unauthenticated remote command execution,
which directly resulted in root access.

## Exploit Customization
A public Exploit-DB Perl script was used and customized by supplying target IP,
port, and payload type to spawn a bind shell. This demonstrates real-world
adaptation of proof-of-concept exploits.

## Obfuscation Awareness
Although no WAF was present, encoding and payload variation were considered
to bypass basic detection mechanisms.

## Objective Achieved
Full system compromise was achieved through a single critical vulnerability.
