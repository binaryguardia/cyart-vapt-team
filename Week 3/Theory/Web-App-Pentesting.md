# Web Application Penetration Testing

Web application security testing focuses on identifying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
through both automated and manual techniques.

## Testing Approach
- Automated testing using sqlmap
- Manual validation using crafted payloads
- Session handling analysis

## Findings
Although DVWA was tested separately for SQL injection, the primary compromise
in this engagement was achieved via network service exploitation.

## Secure Coding Considerations
- Input validation
- Proper authentication
- Least privilege access

Web vulnerabilities remain a critical attack vector when combined with weak
network security.
