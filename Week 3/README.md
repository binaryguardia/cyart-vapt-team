## Week 3 – Advanced Exploitation & Post-Exploitation

This section documents **Week 3 activities** focused on advanced exploitation techniques, post-exploitation, evidence handling, and professional reporting, aligned with the **PTES framework**.

## Focus Areas
- Advanced vulnerability exploitation
- Exploit chaining and payload selection
- Manual and automated web application testing
- Post-exploitation and privilege validation
- Credential harvesting and offline password attacks
- Evidence collection and documentation
- Professional technical and non-technical reporting

## Practical Work
- Exploited real-world vulnerable services on **Metasploitable2**
- Used Metasploit and custom Exploit-DB scripts
- Gained shell access and validated privileges
- Extracted and analyzed `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`
- Prepared hashes using `unshadow` and cracked credentials
- Documented findings with screenshots and logs

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Nmap
- Exploit-DB
- John the Ripper
- Netcat
- sqlmap
- Burp Suite
- Linux post-exploitation utilities

## Deliverables
- Exploitation proof (shell access)
- Post-exploitation artifacts
- Credential analysis results
- Findings tables with severity and impact
- PTES-aligned technical report
- Non-technical executive summary

## Outcome
Week 3 strengthened hands-on skills in **real exploitation, payload handling, privilege validation, and reporting**, simulating real-world penetration testing scenarios.
